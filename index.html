<p> <b> OnlyOffice is just a great alternative to MS Office. First of all, it's open source so you can modify and contribute to it. That also means its free so you don't have to take out money from the bank to write word documents. Now you are probably wondering. Why should I use OnlyOffice because its free? I mean after all there are so much free work related apps.
    Well OnlyOffice looks exactly like MS Office. From pixel to pixel, it looks like MS Office so it will make you feel welcome and at home.
    That also means loads of features packed into a coherent yet seamless workspace. Finally, OnlyOffice supports MS Office formats (like .docx, .pptx, etc) and aswell as having a document editor and writer, a presentation tool that rivals powerpoint and a worthy opponent of Excel. Bonus: It has a pdf editor included. You get all of that for free.

<p><b>LibreOffice is a FOSS (Free and open source software) alternative to MS Office. Because it is open source, you can contribute to it just like OnlyOffice. Unfortunately, when I used LibreOffice on Debian 12 it didn't have a UI similar to MS Office. One great thing it does well is the UI. Despite the fact its UI doesn't look like MS Office, the UI is compact,coherant and feature-packed aswell as the features being integrated well. Like
 OnlyOffice, it has an entire suite including a presentation, spreadsheets and documents app. It also has more apps than OnlyOffice. On top of that, It also is supported on Linux just like OnlyOffice</b> </p>
